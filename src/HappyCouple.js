                        As we started our chat I felt a spark instantly and was really excited to meet him, his sense of humour and the fact that heâ€™s very open about each and everything blew me up and after a few days of chats n calls we finally met I spontaneously felt he was the one with whom I want to spend the rest of my life , he was what I was looking for
                        And each and everyday as we got closer, I realised he is an updated version of my dad! And what more could I ask for rite?

                        When we started talking I tried to impress her in several waysðŸ˜‚ but little did I know that she already had fallen for me ! Sheâ€™s a simple , innocent girl with a childâ€™s heart and I believed she would be her best as my better half , a few days later i was awaiting her response and it was final yes from her side for the win!
