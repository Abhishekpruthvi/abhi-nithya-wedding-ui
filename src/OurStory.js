                    Like every other family, Both our families were looking for a match for each of us ,
                    for me Abhishek the hunt for my bride started way too early ðŸ˜‚ my family peeps were eagerly
                    searching me a match since 3 years! And for Nithya the search started just 3 months earlier ðŸ¤­
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    After talks and chats with others , Abhishekâ€™s brother found Nithyaâ€™s profile on the matrimony
                    and tried to contact them , but as the search was just begun for Nithya here mother who was following up
                    her matrimony page didnâ€™t see it ðŸ˜‚ and after Arround 2 months when Abhishekâ€™s brother finally found Nithyaâ€™s instagram
                    and Facebook , connected with Nithyaâ€™s mother and thats how it all started!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It was 12pm in the noon i was at  work in hospital when my mom shared me
                    Abhishekâ€™s bio data and as i was going through mom called me shared
                    Abhishekâ€™s number and told I would have to talk with him in the evening
                    which made me super nervous as an introvert ðŸ˜‚

                    It was scheduled for a Sunday and I was super anxious so
                    I made sure everything was good for the day so I talked to my friends
                    and sister for the dayâ€™s plan and as I had my work for half the day ,
                    but my bad Abhishek had already reached Mysore ðŸ˜‚
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I quickly asked my friend to drop me home
                    and tada her vehicle gave up and I made abhishek wait for like
                    more than a hourðŸ˜‚ poor boy! Then I quickly got another friend to drop
                    me home, I dressed up and went to himðŸ˜‚
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I took my vespa and he in his enfield reached Karanji lake
                    and took a walk in the cool breeze, with flowers falling
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I took it as a sign ðŸ¤­ after walks and talks we went to Ivaana resort for lunch and I was literally so happy that I didnâ€™t even notice it was already evening ðŸ˜‚ literally felt still wanted to spend more time together and thatâ€™s when it hit me, he was what I was looking for ðŸ¤­
